This github repository includes below parts:

  /src: source code
  
  /util: utility code
  
  /script: auxiliary scripts for stat gathering and parsing
  
  makefile
  
  /out: generated binary files


Data-related resources that are too big to put in github, are placed under zarqa:/tmp/fast_rank, including 
  
  /input: the input files
  
  /tree_model: the generated tree models
  
  /util/ensembles: intermediate ensemble files 


Note that this is not the public release version, because it includes a lot of our auxiliary scripts and unused source code.
